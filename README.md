# What each file means

## Ictogeneity_Classifier.ipynb
The python code that takes data from the excel sheet and then preprocesses it and create the ML models

## icotogeneity_classifier.py
This is the same code as the .ipynb except it is in a .py file

## CIS519_Project_to_submit.m
This is a Matlab file that pulls our raw data from the database and then does the feature selections and preprocessing before writing the data to the excel sheet.
